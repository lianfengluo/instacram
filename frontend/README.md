# Frontend

## Recommended Steps for tackling the assignment
1. Get something basic working with the data provided in `frontend/data`
2. Once you've got something basic working, start hitting the `/dummy/` API, which doesn't require authentication. See docs.
3. Finally, once you've got that working, transition over to use the real API.

## Quickstart

If you're using NPM the following simple scripts are avalable to you to help
your development. This is before you start using the dev server directly.

```bash
# install helper scripts
npm install

# start the dev server on first available port.. likely 8080
npm start

# run the linter to check your js 
npm run lint
```
